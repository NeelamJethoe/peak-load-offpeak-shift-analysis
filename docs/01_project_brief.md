Context
Client A is a local fitness center with a single location. The business wants to reduce peak-time crowding and increase utilization during quiet hours without harming the member experience. 
This project uses one year of historical check-in data (member ID and visit date/time) to identify peak vs off-peak patterns, 
segment members by visit behavior, and estimate how shiftable each segment is toward off-peak hours. 
aThe outcome supports a decision on whether targeted off-peak pricing or incentives are likely to be effective, and for which groups.

Goal
Primary goal
Quantify peak-time demand and identify which member segments drive it. Segment members based on visit behavior and estimate off-peak shift potential per segment to inform targeted interventions.

Secondary questions
Which weekday-by-time-slot periods are structurally peak or quiet, and how stable are these patterns across the year (seasonality)?
Which clear member groups exist based on frequency and visit-time consistency versus flexibility?
Which segments are most likely to shift visits to off-peak hours, and what is a realistic range of peak visits that could be shifted under practical scenarios?

Scope and assumptions
The analysis focuses on check-in timing and frequency only. It excludes staffing, class schedules, capacity limits, and financial outcomes unless separately provided. 
Short-interval duplicate check-ins by the same member are treated as a single visit. Peak periods are defined using a data-driven threshold on the 
busiest weekday-by-time-slot combinations and validated with sensitivity checks. Days with zero recorded visits are treated as possible closure or missing-data days and handled separately.

Deliverables
Demand heatmaps and seasonality overview (peak vs off-peak by weekday and time slot).
Behavior-based member segmentation with clear rules and metrics (e.g., visit frequency, peak-share).
Scenario-based estimates of off-peak shift potential per segment and a prioritized target list.
A concise dashboard/report with key insights and recommended next actions, including a simple pilot measurement plan.
